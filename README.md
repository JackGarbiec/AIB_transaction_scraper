# AIB_transaction_scraper
A flask app that imports recent settled transaction from AIB personal account and saves them to database. The app is the first service out of 3 that I'll develop as part of my budgeting project.
The project's purpose is to automatically manage importing transactions into YNAB budgeting app.
YNAB is an american budgeting app that doesn't work with Irish banks out of the box, and so users have to key in every single transaction they make and the categorize them, it's really tedious and time consuming. Therefore my goal is to automate the entire process.
